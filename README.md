# CS245-project2

Hey sorry for the late work. I tried to make the JSON part work but could'nt and thats why I held onto to it. In the zip folder I included some text files that work with my program.

//TO run it just to: java A3
it should ask for actor 1 and actor 2 and will exist if it finds no actor
it is also case sensitive 
it will not read any "new actors"--like "Tom Holland" wont work
Have to put older ones like Heath Ledger or Kevin Bacon
